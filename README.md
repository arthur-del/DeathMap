# DeathMap
DeathMap is a project dedicated to extracting a given player deaths in the minimap for League of Legends 
This project was meant to teach me how to create a backend and make API calls whilst providing real life utility :)

To run this repository you need to:
1. Have python 3.8.2 installed on your computer
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal
3. Provide your own League of Legends developper API key in deathMap.py line 10
4. Enjoy!
