# DeathMap
DeathMap is a project dedicated to extracting a given player deaths in the minimap for League of Legends 
This project was meant to teach me how to create a backend and make API calls whilst providing real life utility :)

To run this repository you need to:
1. Have python 3.8.2 installed on your computer
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal
3. Provide your own League of Legends developper API key in deathMap.py line 10
4. Open a terminal and use "python backend_api_setup.py" to run the localhost 
5. Open another terminal and use "python request.py" to try the requests and get the death coordinates of a specified username
6. cheers! :)

Note: deathMap.py contains commented code that can create a visual representation of the death map in matplotlib and can be run by following instructions on the file + "python deathMap.py" in a terminal. This is because I'll be moving the visual representation to a frontend project.
